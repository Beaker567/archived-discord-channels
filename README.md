# archived-discord-channels

*** archiving our static's strat channels when we're done - to keep the channel count down ***

1. export channel-to-be-archived to html using https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter
2. upload html file to github
3. provide link to github'd html file, in pinned note in our static's main chat channel
   (already 'published' a website from github, https://beaker567.github.io/archived-discord-channels/, just need to create a link with that and append the html filename)
4. delete archived channel from discord
